# Stock Market Investment Analysis Project 
---

## In this project, I worked on how can I analyze Stock Market. 

1. I downloaded Historical Data of prices for five companies and VTI for the past 5 years from Yahoo Finance.

- I chose (Facebook, Alibaba, Amazon, Apple, and Netflix).

2. I Made the plot of the prices of the shares over the past 5 years.

3. I build a Stock portfolio using stocks that I did choose.
----

## For Analysis of 5 years past,

1- I imagined I have $1M to invest and allocate that money into my portfolio as if I had bought it on Jan 1st, 2016.

2- Imagined I have another $1M that I would invest in VTI completely

Finally, I choose a portfolio that outperforms the market over 5 years without modifying it.
